# NBA Prediction Project v2 🏀

> **Note:** This project is currently a work in progress.

This is a comprehensive rework of my original NBA prediction machine learning project, focusing on improved reliability, engineering practices, and prediction accuracy.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Enhanced Reliability & Open Source Focus
- Migration from SaaS solutions to open-source alternatives
  - Using GitHub as primary data store (previously Hopsworks)
  - Implementing MLFlow for experiment tracking (replacing Neptune)
  - MLFlow for model registry management (replacing Hopsworks)
- Redundant deployment architecture
- Container-based deployment strategy

### Software Engineering Improvements
- Object-Oriented Programming implementation
- Enhanced modularity and component isolation
- Comprehensive logging system
- Robust error handling
- Extensive testing infrastructure

### Model Enhancements
- Expanded data collection through advanced scraping
- Integration of ELO scoring system
- Advanced feature selection methodology
- Increased experimental iterations
- Target accuracy improvement to ~65%

### Documentation & Transparency
- Detailed technical documentation
- Process discussion and methodology explanations
- Decision-making rationale

### Deployment Strategy
- Multi-provider deployment architecture
- Self-hosted solutions
- Cloud platform integration
- Redundant deployment systems
