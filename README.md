# NBA Prediction Project v2 üèÄ

> **Note:** This project is currently a work in progress.

This is a comprehensive rework of my original NBA prediction machine learning project, focusing on improved reliability, engineering practices, and prediction accuracy.

## üéØ Project Goals

### Enhanced Reliability & Open Source Focus
- Migration from SaaS solutions to open-source alternatives
  - Using GitHub as primary data store (previously Hopsworks)
  - Implementing MLFlow for experiment tracking (replacing Neptune)
  - MLFlow for model registry management (replacing Hopsworks)
- Redundant deployment architecture
- Container-based deployment strategy

### Software Engineering Improvements
- Object-Oriented Programming implementation
- Enhanced modularity and component isolation
- Comprehensive logging system
- Robust error handling
- Extensive testing infrastructure
- Dependency injection throughout
- Abstract interfaces for swappable implementations

### Architecture Highlights
- **Model-Aware Preprocessing**: Automatic preprocessing based on model family (tree models skip scaling, linear models get standardization)
- **Abstracted Model Registry**: Swappable registry backends (MLflow, custom, cloud services)
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Domain features (NBA stats) separate from model preprocessing (scaling/encoding)
- **Reproducible Inference**: Fitted preprocessors saved with models for identical transforms at inference
- **Production-Ready**: Versioning, staging workflows, batch inference, input validation

### Model Enhancements
- Expanded data collection through advanced scraping
- Integration of ELO scoring system
- Advanced feature engineering (rolling averages, streaks, opponent-adjusted stats)
- Model-specific preprocessing pipelines
- Increased experimental iterations
- Target accuracy improvement to ~65%

### Documentation & Transparency
- Detailed technical documentation in [docs/AI/](docs/AI/)
- Process discussion and methodology explanations
- Decision-making rationale
- Architecture guides and usage examples

### Deployment Strategy
- Multi-provider deployment architecture
- Cloud platform integration
- Redundant deployment systems
- Stage-based model deployment (Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production)
