# Streamlit Dashboard Prototype

This directory hosts the Streamlit implementation for the NBA predictions control panel. It uses the project's dependency-injection patterns so that configuration, logging, and file-handling align with the rest of the codebase.

## Running Locally

```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

The app loads the most recent `dashboard_data.csv` generated by the nightly pipeline via `DashboardDataService`. Archived snapshots are discoverable from the sidebar selector when they exist under `data/dashboard/archive/`.

## Next Steps

- Flesh out matchup cards, reliability indicators, and KPI panels using the cached dataset.
- Add dedicated Streamlit pages under `streamlit_app/pages/` for historical calibration and team drill-down views.
- Integrate lightweight smoke tests exercising `DashboardDataService` to catch schema or path regressions before deployment.
