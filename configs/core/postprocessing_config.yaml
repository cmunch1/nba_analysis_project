# Postprocessing Configuration
# This config manages postprocessing operations applied to model outputs after training.
# Postprocessing is a top-level module (ml_framework.postprocessing) that transforms
# model predictions before final deployment.

# Probability Calibration Settings
# Calibration corrects model probability outputs to better reflect true likelihoods
calibration:
  # Master switch for probability calibration
  enable: true

  # Calibration optimization (automatic method selection)
  optimize: true # Enable automatic calibration method selection via grid search
  optimization:
    methods: [sigmoid, isotonic] # Calibration methods to search over
    evaluation_bins: [5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 20] # Bin sizes for ECE during optimization (NOT for plotting)
    selection_metric: brier_score # Metric for selection: 'brier_score', 'ece', or 'log_loss'
    cv_folds: 5 # Number of CV folds for robust evaluation (use 1 for simple split)
    use_cv: true # Use cross-validation for evaluation (more robust but slower)

  # Manual calibration settings (used when optimize: false)
  method: isotonic # 'sigmoid' (Platt scaling) or 'isotonic' (isotonic regression)
  cv_folds: 5 # Number of CV folds (use 'prefit' for already trained models)

  # Calibration evaluation and output
  save_curves: true # Save calibration curve plots
  save_metrics: true # Save calibration metrics (Brier score, ECE, log loss)
  curve_bins: 10 # Number of bins for plotting calibration curves (10 is industry standard)

  # Chart output directory (inherited from visualization config if not specified)
  # charts_output_dir: "${PROJECT_ROOT}/ml_artifacts/visualizations/charts"

  # Model registry integration
  save_to_registry: true # Save calibration artifact with model

# Conformal Prediction Settings
# Adds uncertainty-aware prediction sets and probability intervals on top of calibrated probabilities
conformal:
  enable: true                # Master switch for conformal prediction
  method: split                # Currently supported: 'split' (standard split conformal)
  alphas:
    prediction_set: 0.1        # Target miscoverage for prediction sets (e.g., 90% coverage)
    probability_interval: 0.2  # Target miscoverage for probability intervals (e.g., 80% central interval)
  score_function: probability_shortfall  # Options: 'probability_shortfall', 'absolute_error'
  class_labels: [away, home]   # Optional ordered labels [negative, positive]
  allow_empty_set: false       # If false, fallback to full set when conformal set would be empty
  min_calibration_samples: 50  # Skip conformal fitting when calibration set is too small
  save_metrics: true           # Persist conformal coverage metrics alongside calibration metrics
  save_diagnostics: true       # Store per-bin empirical coverage summaries for dashboards
  save_to_registry: true       # Persist conformal artifact with the model when saving

# Future postprocessing modules can be added here
# Examples:
# - Threshold optimization
# - Prediction smoothing
# - Ensemble aggregation
# - Uncertainty quantification
