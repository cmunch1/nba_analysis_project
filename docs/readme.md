# Overview

## Summary of Steps

### Develop Model to Predict NBA Games

- Scrape NBA boxscores and upcoming games from NBA.com
- Process the scraped data
- Engineer features likely to improve model accuracy
- Select out features to reduce noise
- Train a model via multiple experiments with different configurations and feature sets
- Evaluate model performance

### Deploy Model

- Create API to access model
- Create dashboard to visualize model predictions

### Monitor Model

- Monitor model performance and API access


## Project Structure

 - configs (yaml files for configuration settings)
 - data (scraped, processed, etc.)
 - docs (overview, etc.)
 - logs (logging output)
 - notebooks (exploratory data analysis)
 - src (source code)
 - tests (unit tests)
